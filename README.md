# Jammming Project

## Description

Jammming is a web application built with React, allowing users to search for songs, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify accounts. With integration to the Spotify API, users can search by song title, artist, or genre and view detailed information such as song title, artist, and album. Users can also create personal playlists and save them directly to their Spotify accounts.

## Features

- **Search for songs** by song title, artist, genre, and more.
- **View detailed song information** including title, artist, and album.
- **Create custom playlists** and manage them.
- **Save playlists to your Spotify account.**

## Current Status

The project is almost complete. However, I am currently experiencing an issue when trying to save playlists to Spotify, receiving a **401 Unauthorized error**. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/jammming.git`
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd jammming`

3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`

4. Start the development server:  
   `npm start`

5. Open your browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Improvements

- Resolve the **401 error** for saving playlists to Spotify.
- Enhance user interface and experience.
- Implement additional playlist management features.
